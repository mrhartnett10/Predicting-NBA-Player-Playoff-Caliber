    "I will mainly use clustering and unsupervised modeling techniques to create clusters of players based on their recorded statstics. Currently the idea is to seperate into pools of stars (players who play above 35 min), role players (15-35) and bench players (less than 15). Then with these different sets will use KMeans (seems to be most successful) to cluster as well by position to determine the trending statistics required to be on a championship level winning team. I also plan on using PCA to help analzye the new data to see where the current players map against the targeted clusters.\n",

I was then able to merge the basic statistics with the correct corresponding advanced statistics along with the correction position of the player. All that remains for data is scraping for the current players, but I should be able to use essentially the same scraping methods so do not anticipate any road blocks. (I will possibly tweak which data features I elect to use but am comfortable with the scraping process thus far)."

I also decided to perform a correlation heat map out of curiosity but not totally sure if it will be required/relevant. I would like to expand more on EDA through creating subsets based on the above minutes per game categroy but have performed some groupby's based on position for star players. Since I am focusing mainly on unsupervised modeling I anticipate additional EDA bulk will be explored during my modeling phase.\n",

I have seen some interesting surface level findings from KMeans in that some the stastics seem to trend into Big Men vs More Skilled PG/SG (smaller positions), but would like to perform modeling again based on position and defined minutes per game categories (stars, role, bench). \n",
